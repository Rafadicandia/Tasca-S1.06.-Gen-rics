## üìÑ Description - Exercise Statement



## **Exercise 1**
Create a class called **NoGenericMethods** that stores three arguments of the same type, along with methods to store and retrieve these objects and a constructor to initialize the three. Check that the arguments can be placed in any position in the call to the constructor.

***

## **Exercise 2**
Create a class called **Person** with the attributes name, surname, and age. Then create a class called **GenericMethods** with a generic method that accepts three arguments of a generic type. This method should only print the arguments it has received to the screen. In the `main()` of the main class, call the generic method with different types of parameters.

**Example**: an object of the Person class, a String, and a primitive type.

This way you have verified that any type of parameter can be passed to it and in any order.
